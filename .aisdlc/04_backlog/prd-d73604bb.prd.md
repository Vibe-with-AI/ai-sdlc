# Product Requirements Document
**Time Formatter Utility Implementation**
*PRD Version 1.0 - Generated from idea-82bde7d0*

## 1. Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the implementation of a time formatter utility function that will convert timestamps into human-readable relative time strings. This implementation serves as a proof-of-concept for the AI-powered development workflow while delivering practical utility for the project.

## 2. Problem Statement
Developers need a consistent and reliable way to display relative timestamps (e.g., "2 minutes ago") throughout the application. Currently, there's no standardized utility for this purpose, leading to potential inconsistencies and duplicate code.

## 3. Solution Overview
A TypeScript utility function that converts Date objects or timestamps into human-readable relative time strings, with comprehensive error handling and type safety.

### Key Features
- Relative time formatting
- TypeScript type safety
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit test coverage
- Easy integration into existing codebase

## 4. User Personas
1. **Developer**
   - Primary user of the utility
   - Needs clean API and clear documentation
   - Requires type safety and reliability

2. **End User**
   - Indirect beneficiary
   - Expects consistent and intuitive time representations

## 5. Functional Requirements

### Input Handling
- Must accept Date objects
- Must accept numeric timestamps (milliseconds since epoch)
- Must accept ISO 8601 date strings

### Output Formatting
- "just now" (< 1 minute)
- "X minutes ago" (1-59 minutes)
- "X hours ago" (1-23 hours)
- "X days ago" (1-30 days)
- "X months ago" (1-12 months)
- "X years ago" (> 12 months)

### Error Handling
- Invalid input types return error message
- Future dates return "in X time"
- Null/undefined inputs throw TypeError

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Function execution under 1ms
- No external dependencies

### Code Quality
- 100% test coverage
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint compliance
- Documentation via JSDoc

### Maintainability
- Clear function and variable naming
- Modular design
- Comprehensive comments

## 7. User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to format timestamps so that users see relative times
2. As a developer, I want TypeScript support so that I get compile-time type checking
3. As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling so that my app doesn't crash
4. As a developer, I want unit tests so that I can refactor with confidence

## 8. Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 100% test coverage
- 0 TypeScript errors
- 0 ESLint warnings
- Function performance < 1ms

### Quality Metrics
- Successful code review
- Documentation completeness
- No reported bugs in first month

## 9. Dependencies

### Development Dependencies
- TypeScript
- Jest testing framework
- ESLint
- Project's existing build tools

### Runtime Dependencies
- None (pure JavaScript implementation)

## 10. Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work in all modern browsers
- Must support Node.js environment
- Maximum bundle size increase: 1KB

### Project Constraints
- Implementation time: 2 days maximum
- Must follow existing project conventions
- Must maintain backward compatibility

## 11. Timeline

### Phase 1: Implementation (Day 1)
- Create initial implementation
- Write TypeScript types
- Add JSDoc documentation

### Phase 2: Testing (Day 1)
- Write unit tests
- Edge case testing
- Performance testing

### Phase 3: Review & Integration (Day 2)
- Code review
- Address feedback
- Integration testing
- Documentation review

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Function Implementation
   - [ ] Accepts all specified input types
   - [ ] Returns correct relative time strings
   - [ ] Handles all edge cases
   - [ ] Includes proper TypeScript types

2. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests cover all cases
   - [ ] Tests pass consistently
   - [ ] Edge cases tested
   - [ ] Performance tests pass

3. Documentation
   - [ ] JSDoc comments complete
   - [ ] README updated
   - [ ] Usage examples provided

4. Integration
   - [ ] Exported from utils index
   - [ ] No conflicts with existing code
   - [ ] Builds successfully
   - [ ] Passes CI checks

This PRD serves as the definitive guide for implementing the time formatter utility function and will be used to track progress and ensure successful delivery of the feature.
