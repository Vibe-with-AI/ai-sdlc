# User Authentication System

## Problem Statement
Our application currently lacks a secure user authentication system. Users cannot create accounts, log in, or manage their profiles securely.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a comprehensive user authentication system with the following features:

### Core Features
- User registration with email verification
- Secure login/logout functionality
- Password reset capability
- User profile management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Technical Requirements
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Session management
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure password policies
- Account lockout after failed attempts

## Success Metrics
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- < 2 second response time for login
- Zero security breaches
- 95% user satisfaction with login experience

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic login/registration (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Profile management (1 week)
- Phase 3: RBAC and MFA (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Security hardening (1 week)

## Dependencies
- Database setup
- Email service integration
- Frontend UI components
- Security audit tools
