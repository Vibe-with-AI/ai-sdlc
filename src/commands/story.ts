Generate 3-5 user stories that:
1. Are Independent and don't block each other
2. Are Negotiable and can be refined
3. Provide clear Value to users
4. Are Estimable with story points (1,2,3,5,8,13)
5. Are Small enough to complete in one sprint
6. Are Testable with clear acceptance criteria

For each story, provide:
- User story format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Detailed description
- Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Technical tasks
- Story point estimate
- Dependencies
