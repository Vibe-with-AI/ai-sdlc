.ai/done/ â€“ Completed items are moved here after passing review (i.e., Done in Scrum terms). A story file in done/ indicates that the feature has met its acceptance criteria and is potentially shippable. Optionally, these files could be appended with a summary of what was done, test results, or links to documentation. This provides a historical log of delivered increments per sprint.
