File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

.ai/agents/ – Contains role definition files for each agent. These could be YAML/JSON or TypeScript modules describing the agent’s persona, goals, and the LLM or tools it uses. For example, planner.yml might specify that the Planner agent uses Claude 2 with a system prompt guiding it to act as a Product Owner, whereas builder.yml might specify using a code-generation model (like GPT-4 or Gemini) and RepoMix for context. Each role file defines the agent’s responsibilities and expertise in alignment with Scrum (e.g. Planner = backlog grooming, Builder = coding tasks, etc.

.ai/prompts/ – Houses reusable prompt templates for various tasks. For instance, planning_prompt.txt could be a template the Planner agent fills in to turn an idea into user stories, and review_prompt.txt might be used by the Reviewer agent to evaluate code against requirements. Keeping prompts in separate files makes them easier to refine and test.


he prompts will be stored in a prompts/ folder in your repository:

prompts/idea-to-prd.md: Generates a concise PRD from an idea.
prompts/prd-chunking.md: Splits the PRD into chunks.
prompts/stakeholder-validation.md: Validates PRD chunks.
prompts/stories-generation.md: Creates user stories from chunks.
prompts/sprint-planning.md: Plans sprints and assigns tasks.
The CLI will execute these prompts sequentially, passing outputs as inputs (e.g., prompts/prd.md to prompts/chunks.md), with final deliverables in .ai/doing/migrate-rest-to-trpc.

You are an Agile product manager transforming a raw idea into a concise Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a solo builder with up to 10 coding agents. You have access to:
- **Context7 MCP Server**: For accessing documentation on APIs, libraries, or third-party services (e.g., tRPC, Drizzle, Supabase).
- **GitHub**: For CRUD operations to reference codebase files and store outputs in `prompts/`.
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: For reasoning to define clear objectives, features, and technical requirements.

Perform the following tasks:
1. **Analyze Idea**: Review the idea to identify core objectives, target users, and desired features. Use Sequential Thinking MCP to ensure focus.
2. **Define Scope**: List in-scope features and explicitly out-of-scope items to keep the PRD concise (~2-5k tokens).
3. **Specify Technical Requirements**: Outline key libraries, APIs, and file paths (read-only: [CODEBASE_FILES], writeable: [WRITEABLE_FILES]), using Context7 MCP Server for accuracy.
4. **Structure PRD**: Format the PRD with sections for executive summary, objectives, features, technical requirements, and success metrics.
5. **Store Output**: Save as a markdown file in `prompts/prd.md`. Provide GitHub commit instructions (commit to [BRANCH_NAME]).
6. **Output Format**: Structured markdown with sections for PRD content and commit instructions.

**Inputs**:
- Idea Content: [IDEA_CONTENT]
- Read-Only Codebase Files: [CODEBASE_FILES]

You are an Agile Scrum Master planning capacity for a 5-agent team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, 2 Builders, 1 Reviewer) over a 2-week sprint in a Rolling Kanban model. You have access to:
- **Context7 MCP Server**: For accessing team process documentation or tool constraints.
- **GitHub**: For CRUD operations to review historical velocity in `{REPO_PATH}` or `{INDEX_FILE}`.
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: For calculating realistic capacity.

Perform the following tasks:
1. **Estimate Team Capacity**: Assume each agent contributes `{HOURS_PER_DAY}` hours/day over `{WORKING_DAYS}` days. Account for Scrum Master and Product Owner overhead (`{OVERHEAD_HOURS}` hours/day each).
2. **Factor in Historical Velocity**: Check `{INDEX_FILE}` or `{REPO_PATH}` for past sprints (default to `{DEFAULT_VELOCITY}` points if no data).
3. **Account for Constraints**: Identify constraints (e.g., `{CONSTRAINT_1}`) using Context7 MCP Server. Adjust capacity by `{ADJUSTMENT_PERCENTAGE}%` for learning or technical debt.
4. **Recommend Sprint Capacity**: Provide a story point capacity (e.g., `{CAPACITY_POINTS}`), balancing workload across 2 Builders and 1 Reviewer.
5. **Store Output**: Format as markdown in `{REPO_PATH}/sprint_{SPRINT_NUMBER}.md`. Update `{INDEX_FILE}` with capacity entry (type: sprint_capacity, status: planned). Provide GitHub commit instructions.
6. **Output Format**: Structured markdown with sections for total hours, historical velocity, constraints, recommended capacity, `{INDEX_FILE}` updates, and commit instructions.

**Inputs**:
- `{HISTORICAL_SPRINT_DATA}`: Historical sprint data (e.g., from `{INDEX_FILE}`).
- `{CONSTRAINTS}`: Known constraints (e.g., `{CONSTRAINT_1}`).
- `{REPO_PATH}`: Repository path (e.g., `.ai/sprint_capacity/`).
- `{INDEX_FILE}`: Index file path (e.g., `.ai/index.yml`).
- `{BRANCH_NAME}`: Branch (default: main).
- `{SPRINT_NUMBER}`: Sprint number (e.g., 1).
- `{HOURS_PER_DAY}`: Hours per day per agent (default: 6).
- `{WORKING_DAYS}`: Working days (default: 10).
- `{OVERHEAD_HOURS}`: Overhead hours per day (default: 2).
- `{DEFAULT_VELOCITY}`: Default velocity (default: 30-40 points).
- `{ADJUSTMENT_PERCENTAGE}`: Capacity adjustment percentage (default: 10-20).

**Example Input**:
- `{HISTORICAL_SPRINT_DATA}`: `None`
- `{CONSTRAINTS}`: `tRPC learning curve, shared middleware implementation`
- `{REPO_PATH}`: `.ai/sprint_capacity/`
- `{INDEX_FILE}`: `.ai/index.yml`
- `{BRANCH_NAME}`: main
- `{SPRINT_NUMBER}`: 1
- `{HOURS_PER_DAY}`: 6
- `{WORKING_DAYS}`: 10
- `{OVERHEAD_HOURS}`: 2
- `{DEFAULT_VELOCITY}`: 30-40
- `{ADJUSTMENT_PERCENTAGE}`: 15

**Example Output**:
```markdown
### Sprint 1 Capacity
**Total Hours**: 5 agents x 6 hours/day x 10 days = 300 hours. Subtract 2 hours/day each for Product Owner and Scrum Master (40 hours total) = 260 hours.
**Historical Velocity**: No data; assume 30-40 points.
**Constraints**: tRPC learning curve, shared middleware implementation. Reduce capacity by 15%.
**Recommended Capacity**: 30 points x 0.85 = 25.5, rounded to 25 points.

Files here (e.g. STORY-001.md) are typically generated or edited by the Planner agent (via ai prd or ai story commands). Each story file also includes XML metadata such as an ID, priority, and acceptance criteria. For example, a backlog user story might include:


``` xml
<userStory id="STORY-001" priority="High" sprint="Sprint 1" status="backlog">
  <title>As a user, I can log in with email and password</title>
  <acceptanceCriteria>
    <criterion>Valid email and password authenticate the user</criterion>
    <criterion>Show error for incorrect credentials</criterion>
  </acceptanceCriteria>
  <relatedTasks>...</relatedTasks>
</userStory>

# **AI-Augmented Scrum: Orchestrating Aider-Powered Agent Fleets with an LLM-Native CLI**

## **1\. Executive Summary: The Vision for AI-Augmented Scrum**

The ambition to fuse the structured agility of Scrum with the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a paradigm shift for software development. This report details a comprehensive blueprint for a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to orchestrate a fleet of Aider-powered AI agents, each mapped to specific Scrum roles and process steps. The core concept aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and sophisticated automation to dramatically accelerate development velocity, enhance code quality, and streamline agile workflows. This system moves beyond mere task automation, fostering a symbiotic collaboration between human developers and AI agents. The following sections will delve into a deep integration of Scrum principles, propose an advanced agentic architecture, elaborate on the evolution of an LLM-native shell, and outline a robust operational framework, significantly enhancing the initial conceptualization of such a system. The objective is to provide a technically sound and forward-looking specification for building a system capable of achieving "Agile at lightspeed."

## **2\. Bridging Scrum and AI: A Deep Integration Framework**

Successfully marrying Scrum methodology with an AI-driven system requires a meticulous translation of Scrum's core components—roles, events, and artifacts—into the operational logic of AI agents and their orchestrating CLI. This ensures that the AI system not only automates tasks but also embodies the principles that make Scrum effective.

### **Mapping Scrum to an Agent-Driven CLI**

The foundation of this integration lies in reimagining Scrum elements within an AI context.

* **Scrum Roles Reimagined:**  
  * **Product Owner (PO) Agent:** This AI agent serves as the digital proxy for the Product Owner. Guided by high-level human input, such as business objectives or market requirements, the PO Agent assumes responsibility for managing and prioritizing the Product Backlog, typically stored in a designated directory like .ai/backlog/. Its capabilities include leveraging LLM-driven prompts for backlog refinement, applying value-scoring methodologies (e.g., MOSCOW prioritization or value vs. effort scoring as outlined in traditional Scrum practices 1), and decomposing high-level Epics into more granular work items.1  
  * **Scrum Master (SM) Agent:** The SM Agent acts as the facilitator for the AI "team." Its primary function is to ensure the smooth operation of the AI-driven Scrum process. This involves monitoring for impediments, such as tasks marked as 'blocked' in the central tracking file (index.yml) or failing tests flagged by specialized Reviewer agents. The SM Agent can also analyze telemetry data (detailed in Section 6\) to suggest process improvements, such as optimizing prompt structures or reallocating agent resources. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that automated "Scrum events" are triggered and executed correctly, effectively removing impediments to the AI team's progress.1  
  * **Development Team Agents (Builders, Reviewer, Fixer):** These agents constitute the core workforce performing development tasks. The "Builder" agents, powered by tools like Aider 2, are analogous to the human Development Team members, responsible for implementing features and functionality. The "Reviewer" and "Fixer" agents are specialized AI assistants that augment the team's quality assurance capabilities, focusing on code review and automated bug correction, respectively. This structure reflects the cross-functional, self-organizing nature of a Scrum Development Team.1  
* **Scrum Events Automated and Augmented:**  
  * **Sprint Planning Agent/Workflow:** This process is initiated via a CLI command, such as ai plan sprint. It involves the PO Agent selecting high-priority items from the Product Backlog. A dedicated "Planner Agent" (discussed further in Section 4\) then takes these items and breaks them down into actionable user stories suitable for inclusion in the Sprint Backlog (which could be represented by items in .ai/in\_progress/ or a distinct sprint backlog file). A key output of this automated event is a clearly defined sprint goal, providing focus for the upcoming development cycle.1  
  * **Daily Scrum Synthesis:** While AI agents do not require a traditional daily stand-up meeting, the spirit of the Daily Scrum—providing progress updates and identifying impediments—is maintained. A Scrum-clock bot or a specialized agent can generate a daily summary by analyzing changes in the index.yml file and aggregating progress logs from various agents. This provides a concise status report for human oversight and ensures transparency.1  
  * **Sprint Review Augmentation:** The CLI tool will facilitate the demonstration of the "Increment"—the sum of completed user stories, typically residing in a done/ directory. It will offer commands to easily showcase new features, run demonstrations, and provide links to associated pull requests or commits. Human stakeholder feedback gathered during this augmented review can be manually entered or potentially ingested by a "Feedback Collector Agent" to inform future Product Backlog refinements.1  
  * **Sprint Retrospective Insights:** The system will collect telemetry data on agent performance, story cycle times, bug introduction rates, and other relevant metrics (see Section 6). A "Retrospective Agent" can analyze this data to identify patterns and suggest areas for improvement. These suggestions might include refining prompts for specific agents, enhancing agent skills through new tools or knowledge, or adjusting workflow configurations to optimize efficiency, mirroring the continuous improvement goal of a traditional Sprint Retrospective.1  
* **Scrum Artifacts Managed Digitally:**  
  * **Product Backlog:** This is a dynamically ordered list of all desired product features, enhancements, and fixes. It resides as a collection of files (e.g., Markdown with YAML front-matter) in the .ai/backlog/ directory and is actively managed by the PO Agent.1  
  * **Sprint Backlog:** This comprises the set of Product Backlog Items selected for a given development cycle (whether a fixed "sprint" or a continuous flow model), along with a plan for delivering them. These items are tracked in the central index.yml file, typically with a status indicating they are in\_progress/.1  
  * **Increment:** This represents the sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a cycle and integrated into the main codebase. Each increment should be potentially releasable. In this AI-driven system, increments are the result of AI agents successfully completing stories, with code auto-committed and potentially auto-proposed for merging.1

### **Adapting Scrum for AI Velocity: The "Rolling Kanban" Model**

Traditional Scrum employs fixed-length sprints, typically lasting one to four weeks, designed around human work rhythms and team synchronization needs.1 However, AI agents operate without such constraints, capable of sustained, 24/7 work. Imposing rigid sprints on an AI workforce could lead to inefficiencies: idle time if work is completed early, or artificial bottlenecks if agents are held back pending a sprint boundary.

A more suitable execution model for an AI-driven system is a continuous flow approach, inspired by Kanban principles.4 Kanban emphasizes visualizing work, limiting Work In Progress (WIP), and managing flow to maximize efficiency.4 This aligns perfectly with the always-on potential of AI agents.

The "Rolling Kanban" model retains Scrum's roles and its focus on delivering value through well-defined artifacts but adopts Kanban's flow mechanics for task execution. This hybrid approach aims to achieve "Agile at light-speed."

* **Rationale for Continuous Flow:** The primary driver is to maximize AI agent utilization and throughput. Instead of batching work into fixed sprints, tasks (user stories) are pulled into the system continuously as agents become available.  
* **Detailed Mechanics of the Scrum-clock Bot:** This automated component, as envisioned in the initial outline, becomes the pacemaker of the continuous flow.  
  * It will perform frequent checks (e.g., hourly or even more often) against the index.yml file for user stories that have a status of ready and a ready\_at timestamp that is current or past.  
  * Prioritization logic will determine the order in which ready stories are picked. This logic can be configured, potentially using priority scores set by the PO Agent, followed by the ready\_at timestamp as a secondary sorting key.  
  * Upon selecting a story, the Scrum-clock Bot will transition its status to in\_progress/ in index.yml and assign it to an available "Builder" agent from the pool.  
  * Crucially, WIP limits will be enforced, either per agent or for the entire "Builder" agent pool. This Kanban practice prevents individual agents from being overloaded and maintains focus, which is essential for efficient task completion even in AI systems.4

This continuous flow model necessitates a re-evaluation of the "Sprint Goal." In traditional Scrum, the Sprint Goal provides coherence and direction for the sprint's work.1 In a continuous stream of individual stories, this overarching focus could be lost. Therefore, the "Sprint Goal" might evolve into a "Cycle Goal" or "Theme Goal." This goal would guide the PO Agent's prioritization efforts for a defined period (e.g., a week or a certain quantum of story points). The CLI command ai plan sprint next N could be re-conceptualized as ai plan cycle \<goal\_description\> for \<duration\_or\_story\_points\>. This adaptation maintains strategic alignment while enabling the tactical flexibility and high throughput of a continuous flow system. The "Sprint" itself transforms from a time-box for *executing* work into a cadence for *planning, review, and goal-setting*, while the development work flows uninterruptedly.

## **3\. Architecture of the LLM-Native Scrum Orchestrator (ai-sh / ai)**

The heart of the AI-augmented Scrum system is its orchestrator: a sophisticated CLI, potentially evolving into an LLM-native shell (ai-sh). This component serves as the primary interface for human interaction and the central control plane for the AI agent fleet.

### **The LLM-Native Shell Revisited**

The initial concept of ai-sh as a wrapper command that streams code and metadata to an LLM represents a significant step towards a more intuitive and powerful user experience. This can be further enhanced:

* **Advanced Natural Language Command Processing:** Moving beyond simple verb-noun parsing, the shell can employ a dedicated LLM (e.g., Claude or a GPT-series model, accessed via a library like llm-cli 6) to interpret complex, conversational commands. For instance, a user might type: "ai-sh show me all high-priority backlog items related to user authentication that are currently blocked and were created by the PO Agent." The shell's embedded LLM would parse this natural language query, translate it into structured API calls to the underlying ai CLI functions, or generate direct queries against index.yml and the project's vector database.  
* **Contextual Awareness and Conversational Memory:** To facilitate natural interaction, the shell should maintain a degree of conversational memory. This could leverage the LLM's inherent context window or employ a dedicated short-term memory mechanism. Such a feature would allow the shell to understand pronouns and references to previous commands or outputs (e.g., "Now, assign *that story* to Builder Agent 3"). This aligns with the importance of memory in effective agentic workflows.8  
* **Proactive Suggestions and Command Completion:** The shell can become an active assistant. By leveraging the embedding graph (detailed in Section 5), it can proactively suggest relevant files, user stories, or even complete commands based on the current conversational context or partially typed input. LLM-powered autocompletion can extend to command names and their parameters, significantly reducing the user's cognitive load.

This evolution transforms the ai-sh from a mere command interpreter into a "meta-agent" or "Conductor Agent." By deeply embedding LLM capabilities 6, the shell itself becomes an intelligent entity. This Conductor Agent can understand user intent at a higher level of abstraction, translate this intent into specific operations for other specialized agents or system components, and synthesize information from diverse sources like index.yml, the vector database, and agent logs. This shift elevates the user experience from issuing imperative commands to engaging in a more goal-oriented, conversational dialogue with the entire AI-driven development system.

### **Core CLI (oclif) Structure and Command Contracts**

Underpinning the LLM-native shell (or serving as the primary interface if the shell is a later addition) is a robust CLI, proposed to be built with a framework like oclif.9 The oclif framework offers features like efficient flag and argument parsing, plugin architecture, auto-documentation, and JSON output support, which are highly beneficial for this application.9

The command contracts outlined in the "v1.1 technical spec" provide a solid starting point. These need to be expanded with greater detail for each command (ai idea, ai prd, ai chunk, ai validate, ai story, ai aide, ai vector sync):

* **Purpose:** A clear statement of what the command achieves.  
* **Parameters:** Detailed specification of all parameters, including their names, types (string, integer, boolean), whether they are required or optional, and any default values.  
* **Expected Inputs:** The data or artifacts the command operates on (e.g., file paths, IDs from index.yml).  
* **Primary Agent(s) Invoked:** Which AI agent(s) are primarily responsible for executing the command's logic.  
* **Key Operations Performed:** A step-by-step description of the actions taken by the command and its associated agents.  
* **Outputs:** The results of the command's execution, such as new files created, updates to index.yml, and messages displayed on the console.

For example, the ai prd \<ideaId\> command would be specified as:

* *Purpose:* Generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) from a validated idea.  
* *Parameters:* \<ideaId\> (string, required) \- The unique identifier of the idea artifact residing in .ai/ideas/ and tracked in index.yml.  
* *Agent(s) Invoked:* Product Owner Agent (or a specialized "PRD Writer Agent").  
* *Operations:*  
  1. Read the content of the specified idea file.  
  2. Load the idea\_to\_prd.md prompt template.  
  3. Populate the template with the idea content and any other relevant context.  
  4. Invoke the configured LLM (e.g., Claude via llm-cli 7 or the Anthropic SDK) with the composed prompt.  
  5. Receive the LLM-generated PRD content.  
  6. Save the PRD content to a new file in .ai/backlog/, e.g., \<prdId\>.prd.md.  
  7. Update index.yml to record the new PRD artifact, linking it to the original idea and setting its initial status.  
* *Outputs:* A new PRD file in .ai/backlog/, an updated index.yml, and a console message indicating success or failure.

Robust error handling is paramount. The CLI must provide clear, actionable error messages when issues occur, leveraging oclif's capabilities.9 Informative feedback during command execution, indicating progress and completion, will enhance usability. Furthermore, all commands should support a \--json flag, an oclif feature 9, to output results in a machine-readable format, facilitating integration with external scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or other automation tools.

The invokeClaude utility mentioned in the "v1.1 spec" should be architected using a library like llm-cli.6 This provides an abstraction layer, allowing the system to easily switch between different LLMs (e.g., various Claude models, GPT versions, or even locally hosted models) for different tasks based on cost, capability, or performance requirements. For instance, a more powerful and expensive model might be used for critical PRD generation, while a faster, cheaper model could suffice for summarization or simple classification tasks.

The following table details the enhanced CLI command contract:

### **File System as State (.ai/ directory)**

The .ai/ directory, with its structured subfolders and the central index.yml file, serves as the persistent state representation for the entire Scrum process.

* **Detailed Schema for index.yml:** This YAML file is the backbone of state tracking. It must have a well-defined schema. Key fields for each artifact entry should include:  
  * id: A unique identifier for the artifact.  
  * type: The kind of artifact (e.g., idea, epic, prd, chunk, story, test\_case, bug\_report, validation\_output).  
  * status: The current state in the workflow (e.g., new, backlog\_refined, ready\_for\_planning, sprint\_backlog, in\_progress, blocked, review\_pending, review\_passed, review\_failed, done, archived).  
  * title: A human-readable title or summary.  
  * priority: A numerical or categorical priority (e.g., P0, P1, critical, high, medium, low).  
  * story\_points: Estimated effort for stories.  
  * owner\_agent\_type: The type of agent that created or last significantly modified the artifact (e.g., POAgent, PlannerAgent).  
  * assigned\_agent\_id: The specific instance of an agent currently working on this item (if applicable).  
  * created\_at: Timestamp of creation.  
  * updated\_at: Timestamp of last modification.  
  * ready\_at: Timestamp indicating when a story becomes eligible for the Scrum-clock bot to pick up (for rolling Kanban).  
  * blocking\_story\_ids: A list of IDs of other stories that this item is blocked by.  
  * related\_artifact\_ids: A list of IDs of related artifacts (e.g., parent epic, source PRD).  
  * source\_file\_path: Path to the primary Markdown file for this artifact.  
* **YAML Front-Matter Standardization:** All Markdown files within the .ai/ directory (e.g., for PRDs, stories) must begin with a YAML front-matter block. This block should contain a subset of the index.yml fields relevant to that specific file (e.g., id, title, status, story\_points). A strict schema for this front-matter ensures consistency for parsing and processing by agents and the CLI.

The index.yml file acts as more than just a status ledger; it functions as the central nervous system for the AI Scrum team. All agents read from and write to index.yml. Changes in its state can trigger subsequent actions by other agents or automated workflows, such as the Scrum-clock bot. This centralized, observable state allows for decoupled agents that can still operate cohesively as a team. Consequently, the reliability and performance of index.yml updates are critical. As the system scales and multiple agents attempt concurrent updates, potential race conditions or performance bottlenecks must be addressed. Implementing a transactional update mechanism or a queuing system for updates to index.yml might become necessary to maintain data integrity and responsiveness.

### **Zero-Click Automation with File System Watchers**

The "Zero-Click Flow," driven by file system watchers like Watchman 11, aims to automate sequences of tasks triggered by simple file operations.

* **Advanced Watchman Configurations:** Instead of basic triggers, watchman-make or custom scripts interacting with Watchman's JSON interface 11 can enable more sophisticated logic. For example, when a new idea file (.ai/ideas/\*.md) is created:  
  1. Watchman triggers ai prd \<idea\_filename\_without\_ext\>.  
  2. If the PRD is successfully created, another Watchman rule (monitoring .ai/backlog/\*.prd.md) could trigger ai chunk \<new\_prd\_id\>. This chaining allows for complex workflows to be initiated by a single user action, like saving a file.  
* **Safety Mechanisms:** Such powerful automation requires robust safety measures:  
  * **Enhanced \--dry-run:** The \--dry-run flag available in the CLI should not merely print the commands it would execute. It should also perform pre-condition validation, such as checking for the existence of required input files or the validity of IDs referenced from index.yml.  
  * **Transactional Operations or Idempotency:** For sequences of commands triggered by Watchman, it's crucial to ensure that the overall operation is either transactional (all steps succeed or all fail and roll back) or that individual steps are idempotent (can be safely retried without adverse effects). This helps manage partial failures gracefully.  
  * **Debouncing/Throttling:** File systems often generate multiple events for a single save operation. Watchman configurations or the trigger-handling scripts should implement debouncing to prevent rapid, redundant executions of command chains.

These file system event triggers function like reflex arcs within the agentic system. A user dropping an idea file into the designated folder can initiate an immediate, automated cascade of actions: Watchman detects the new file, triggering the ai prd command; the PO Agent generates a PRD; another Watchman rule might then detect the new PRD file and trigger the ai chunk command, and so forth. This creates a highly reactive system where initial human input propels a series of AI-driven processes. While this is powerful for automation, this reactivity needs careful management. The potential for unintended loops or cascading failures due to misconfiguration or unexpected agent behavior is a significant risk. Therefore, the "Zero-Click Flow" must be designed with clear boundaries, robust error handling at each step of the chain, and straightforward mechanisms for human users to intervene, pause, or debug the automated sequences. The \--dry-run flag becomes an indispensable tool for understanding and verifying these automated chains before enabling them fully.

## **4\. The AI Agent Mesh: Design and Orchestration**

The "Agent Mesh" is the collective of specialized AI agents working in concert to execute the Scrum process. Each agent has defined roles, responsibilities, tools, and prompts, contributing to the overall workflow.

### **Agent Roles and Responsibilities (Deep Dive)**

Building upon the initial outline, the agent roles are refined and expanded:

* **Planner Agent:**  
  * *Responsibility:* This agent is crucial for translating higher-level requirements into actionable work items. It takes PRDs or Chunks as input and decomposes them into well-defined user stories, adhering to Scrum principles for user story creation.1 A key function is to assist in effort estimation, potentially using LLM capabilities to assign story points. It enriches stories with necessary technical details or acceptance criteria and populates index.yml with these new stories, setting their initial status to ready.  
  * *Trigger:* Typically activated after the ai chunk or ai validate command completes successfully for a PRD or chunk.  
  * *Tools:* LLM API (e.g., Claude, accessed via llm-cli), index.yml update utilities.  
* **Builder Agents (Aider-powered):**  
  * *Responsibility:* These are the primary coding agents. A Builder Agent picks up a user story from the in\_progress/ state in index.yml. It utilizes Aider 2, configured to use an LLM like Claude Sonnet, to write, modify, and test code. The agent programmatically follows Aider's in-chat command sequence: /add relevant files (potentially guided by the embedding graph for context), /msg with the implementation prompt derived from the user story, /lint to check code style, /test to run unit tests, and finally /commit to save the changes to Git with an AI-generated commit message.  
  * *Tools:* Aider, Git, project-specific testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, PyTest), linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).  
* **Reviewer Agent:**  
  * *Responsibility:* This agent performs automated code reviews that go beyond basic linting. It can use an LLM with specialized prompts to check for common anti-patterns, adherence to project-specific coding guidelines, or even potential security vulnerabilities. It may also trigger and parse the results of integration tests. Based on its findings, it updates the story's status in index.yml to review\_passed or review\_failed and generates a review report.  
  * *Tools:* Git (to access code changes), LLM (Claude/GPT), static analysis tools, test execution frameworks.  
* **Fixer Agent (Aider-powered):**  
  * *Responsibility:* This agent is invoked when the Reviewer Agent flags issues or when automated CI tests fail. It takes the issue report (from the Reviewer Agent or CI system) and the problematic code as input. Using Aider, it attempts to automatically fix the identified bugs or address the review comments. Its interaction with Aider is similar to the Builder Agent but is guided by a specific "fix this defect" or "address these review comments" prompt.  
  * *Tools:* Aider, Git, testing frameworks.  
* **Critic Agent:**  
  * *Responsibility:* This agent is a core component of the "Self-Testing Prompts" quality assurance loop. It evaluates the output of other agents (e.g., a PRD generated by the PO Agent, user stories from the Planner Agent, or code produced by a Builder Agent before it's committed) against a predefined set of quality criteria, a "definition of good," or a specific checklist. The Critic doesn't fix issues itself but provides structured feedback on what needs improvement. This aligns with identifying weaknesses in generated content, akin to a focused quality check.13  
  * *Tools:* LLM (Claude/GPT) armed with specific critic prompts tailored to the artifact type being evaluated.  
* **New Proposed Agents for Enhanced Capability:**  
  * **Epic Decomposer Agent:** Addresses the initial stages of backlog creation. It takes high-level epics, as defined in Scrum 1, and breaks them down into smaller, more manageable features or preliminary PRD outlines. These outputs then serve as refined inputs for the PO Agent.  
  * **Stakeholder Simulator Agent:** Useful during validation phases. This agent can adopt various stakeholder personas (e.g., "non-technical end-user," "marketing manager," "data security officer") and provide LLM-generated feedback on proposed features, UI mockups, or PRD drafts. This offers a way to anticipate diverse perspectives early in the process.  
  * **Documentation Agent:** Post-development, after code changes are successfully merged, this agent can be tasked with drafting or updating relevant documentation. This could include README files, API specifications, or inline code comments, potentially using Aider or direct LLM calls.

**Prompt Engineering Strategies:** Effective agent performance hinges on well-crafted prompts. For each agent, the system message should clearly define its role, responsibilities, and operational constraints (e.g., "You are a meticulous AI Code Reviewer. Your goal is to identify potential bugs, style violations, and deviations from best practices..."). User prompts should include placeholders for dynamic content, such as {{story\_id}}, {{code\_snippet\_to\_review}}, {{issue\_description\_from\_ci}}, and {{context\_files}} (as suggested in the v1.1 spec for Aider context). Role-playing ("You are Lead PM...") is a powerful technique for system messages.

The following table summarizes the AI Agent Mesh:

### **Aider Integration Masterclass**

Aider 2 is the linchpin for agents that interact directly with the codebase. Its effective integration is critical.

* **Optimizing Aider's In-Chat Commands for Autonomy:** The Builder and Fixer agents will programmatically drive Aider's Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). This involves the ai aide CLI command (or a similar internal function) sending Aider's chat commands (e.g., /add, /run, /commit 2) and parsing its output to determine the next action or success/failure. The sequence /add \<files\_for\_context\>, /msg \<implementation\_prompt\>, /lint, /test, /commit is a strong foundation. Crucially, the /undo command must be part of the agent's toolkit for error recovery, allowing it to roll back unsatisfactory changes suggested by the LLM via Aider.  
* **Advanced .aider.conf.yml Configurations:** Aider's configuration file (.aider.conf.yml) allows for customization.3 The hooks directive (e.g., pre\_command, post\_command) can be used to trigger custom scripts for logging, telemetry, or conditional logic before or after Aider executes a command. The system\_message can be dynamically tailored by the orchestrating CLI based on the specific agent role (e.g., injecting the AGENT\_ID or task-specific instructions).  
* **Managing Context Windows with Large Models:** While models like Claude Sonnet boast large context windows (e.g., 200k tokens), these can still be exhausted with extensive codebases or long conversational histories. Strategies to manage this include:  
  * Utilizing Aider's repository map feature, which helps the LLM understand the overall project structure without loading all files into context.3  
  * Leveraging the embedding graph (Section 5\) for precise, targeted context injection using Aider's /add command. Only the most relevant code snippets or documents are added.  
  * Implementing agent-driven summarization for very long files or prior discussion threads before they are passed to Aider's context.  
  * Using Aider's feature to spill excess context into a CONTEXT.md file, which can be referenced.

Aider effectively serves as the "hands" of the coding agents. While the LLM (Claude) provides the reasoning and suggests code changes, Aider is the tool that physically applies these changes to the files in the local Git repository and executes Git commands like commit.2 The robustness of Aider and the clarity of its interface (even when driven programmatically) are therefore paramount. The design of the ai aide command and its Docker wrapper must be resilient to handle Aider's interactive nature and reliably parse its outputs. Any instability or ambiguity in the interaction with Aider will directly impair the coding agents' ability to function.

### **Inter-Agent Communication and Collaboration**

Effective collaboration between specialized agents is key to the mesh's success.

* **Protocols for Handoffs:** Primarily, inter-agent communication and task handoffs will occur through changes in index.yml and the creation/modification of file system artifacts. For example, Agent A completes its task, updates the relevant item's status in index.yml, and perhaps creates an output file. Agent B (or a Watchman trigger) detects this state change or new file and initiates the next step in the workflow.  
* **Supervisor Agent Patterns:** As task complexity grows, a more sophisticated orchestration mechanism than simple linear handoffs may be required. The ai-sh (LLM-Native Shell) can act as a high-level supervisor for user-initiated, multi-step commands. For more complex internal processes (e.g., the entire lifecycle from "Epic to Deployed Feature"), a dedicated "Workflow Supervisor Agent" could be introduced. This agent would manage a state machine for the workflow, invoking other specialist agents as needed, orchestrating parallel work (e.g., multiple Builder agents working on different stories simultaneously), and handling complex error recovery logic (e.g., retrying a failed task with a different agent or escalating to human attention). This aligns with recommendations for hierarchical agent systems with supervisors delegating to sub-agents.14  
* **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Considerations:** While direct, real-time A2A messaging might be an advanced feature for later versions, the architecture should not preclude it. If polling index.yml becomes a bottleneck for highly interactive workflows, future iterations could explore lightweight message queues (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ) or a shared event bus for more direct agent coordination. The principles of clear interfaces and standardized data exchange formats, highlighted as important for A2A protocols 15, should be considered even for file-based handoffs to ease future transitions.

The system, therefore, evolves into a society of agents. As the complexity of tasks managed by the AI system increases, the need for more sophisticated coordination becomes apparent. A supervisor agent can effectively manage dependencies between tasks, orchestrate work across multiple specialist agents, and implement more robust error handling and recovery strategies than simple linear handoffs would allow.14 Designing agent interfaces (even if initially file-based or index.yml-centric) with an eye towards future A2A communication—for example, by standardizing message formats for task descriptions and results—would be a prudent architectural decision, facilitating scalability and the adoption of more advanced inter-agent collaboration patterns.15

### **Self-Testing Prompts & Quality Assurance**

The "Critic → Fixer" loop is a powerful mechanism for proactive quality assurance, enabling the AI system to reflect on and improve its own work.

* **Detailed Critic → Fixer Loop Implementation:**  
  1. **Draft:** An initial artifact is generated by a primary agent (e.g., the Planner Agent generates user stories; a Builder Agent generates a code module).  
  2. **Critic:** A dedicated LLM agent (the Critic Agent) evaluates this draft. Its prompt contains specific instructions to assess the draft against a checklist of quality criteria. For a user story, criteria might include clarity, completeness, testability, and adherence to the INVEST model. For code, criteria could include correctness, efficiency, adherence to style guides, and absence of common anti-patterns. The Critic outputs a structured list of specific issues or areas for improvement. This process is akin to identifying weaknesses or flaws in the generated output.13  
  3. **Fixer:** If the Critic identifies issues, the Fixer Agent is invoked. This could be the original agent re-prompted with the Critic's feedback, or a specialized Fixer agent. The Fixer takes the original draft and the Critic's feedback as input and attempts to address all identified issues, generating a revised draft.  
  4. **Loop:** The revised draft is then submitted back to the Critic Agent for re-evaluation. This loop can continue for a configurable number of iterations or until the Critic deems the artifact satisfactory (i.e., it "passes" the quality check).  
  5. **Accept:** Once the Critic passes the artifact, it is accepted and proceeds to the next stage in the workflow (e.g., the code is committed, the story status is updated in index.yml).  
* **Integrating Automated Testing:** This loop is further strengthened by integrating automated tests. Beyond Aider's built-in /lint and /test commands 3, which are suitable for developer-driven interaction and basic checks, the Reviewer Agent should be capable of triggering more comprehensive test suites (e.g., integration tests, end-to-end tests where feasible). The results of these tests (pass/fail, error messages, coverage reports) can be parsed and fed into the Critic/Fixer loop or used to flag an item for human attention if automated fixes fail.

This proactive quality control via AI meta-cognition—the system's ability to critique and correct its own outputs—is a significant step. By having one AI agent (the Critic) evaluate another's work (the Draft), the system can identify and rectify errors, inconsistencies, or quality shortfalls before they propagate further downstream or require human intervention. This reduces the burden on human QA and leads to higher-quality artifacts being produced autonomously. The effectiveness of this loop hinges on the quality and specificity of the Critic's prompts and the evaluation criteria it uses. This self-correction mechanism can be applied to a wide range of artifacts generated by the AI system, including PRDs, user stories, code, test cases, and even documentation, paving the way for more robust, self-healing, and self-improving AI development systems.

## **5\. Intelligent Context Management: The Embedding Graph**

For AI agents to perform complex tasks effectively, especially in large codebases or projects with extensive documentation, they require access to relevant context. An embedding graph serves as the collective long-term memory of the AI Scrum team, enabling intelligent retrieval of this context.

* **Choosing Embedding Models and Vector Database:**  
  * **Models:** The choice of embedding model impacts the quality of semantic search. Options range from open-source Sentence Transformers models, which offer good performance and local deployment, to proprietary models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or newer offerings from Anthropic and Google. Trade-offs involve embedding dimensionality, computational cost, and the nuance of semantic understanding.  
  * **Vector Database:** For storing and querying these embeddings, lightweight options like sqlite-vectordb (as suggested in the initial outline) or txtai (mentioned in the "First Steps") are suitable for getting started and for smaller projects.7 As the scale of the project and the number of artifacts grow, dedicated vector databases such as Weaviate, Pinecone, or ChromaDB may offer better performance, scalability, and advanced features.  
* **Strategies for Embedding Diverse Artifacts:**  
  * **Chunking:** Long documents (e.g., PRDs, extensive source code files, lengthy discussion logs) need to be broken down into smaller, semantically coherent chunks before embedding. Optimal chunking strategies vary by content type: paragraphs or sections for prose, functions or classes for code, or fixed token sizes with overlap as a general approach.  
  * **Metadata:** Storing rich metadata alongside each embedding is crucial. This metadata should include attributes like the original file path, artifact type (e.g., prd\_section, code\_function, user\_story\_acceptance\_criteria), creation date, story ID it relates to, and the agent that authored it. This metadata enables powerful filtered semantic searches (e.g., "find code examples related to 'authentication' in Python files modified in the last month").  
* **Advanced Retrieval Techniques:**  
  * **Semantic Search:** The standard approach, using vector similarity (e.g., cosine similarity or dot product) to find chunks whose embeddings are closest to the query embedding.  
  * **Hybrid Search:** Combining keyword-based search (e.g., using SQLite's FTS5 full-text search capabilities or Elasticsearch) with semantic search often yields more relevant results, as it caters to both exact matches and conceptual similarity.  
  * **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR):** When retrieving multiple results (top-N), MMR helps to diversify the retrieved set, avoiding redundant information and providing a broader contextual overview.  
* **Dynamic Context Injection into Prompts:** This is where the embedding graph delivers significant value. When an agent begins a task (e.g., a Builder Agent starting work on a user story), the orchestrating CLI (or the agent itself) queries the vector database. The query would typically be the text of the user story or a summary of the task. The vector DB returns the top-N most relevant artifact chunks. These retrieved snippets (which could be relevant code examples from other modules, sections from the PRD explaining the feature, or past decisions recorded in meeting notes) are then formatted and dynamically injected into the agent's prompt, often into a placeholder like {{context\_files}} or a dedicated \#\# Relevant Context: section. This ensures the LLM has the most pertinent information readily available when generating its response or code. The /ask backlog "search phrase" command, envisioned in the user outline, would directly query this embedding graph to answer user questions about the project.

The embedding graph effectively becomes the collective, searchable, long-term memory for the AI Scrum team. By embedding all project artifacts—Scrum artifacts like PRDs and stories 1, source code, design documents, and even summaries of important discussions—the system creates a rich, interconnected knowledge base. When an agent requires context to perform its task, it can query this "memory" to retrieve relevant prior decisions, code patterns, requirements details, or solutions to similar problems encountered in the past. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of agents "forgetting" critical information, re-deriving solutions unnecessarily, or producing work inconsistent with prior decisions. This capability directly addresses the goal of removing "75% of copy-paste glue" by automating context provision. The quality of the embeddings, the chunking strategy, and the sophistication of the retrieval mechanism are all critical factors determining the effectiveness of this intelligent memory system. It also empowers human users with powerful new ways to query and understand the project's history and current state via the ai-sh.

## **6\. Operational Excellence: Git, CI/CD, and Telemetry**

A robust operational framework encompassing version control, continuous integration/delivery, and comprehensive telemetry is essential for the stability, reliability, and continuous improvement of the AI-augmented Scrum system.

### **Git as the Source of Truth**

Git will serve as the definitive record of all code changes made by the AI agents. Aider's inherent Git integration 3 is a key enabler.

* **Advanced Git Hook Strategies:** Git hooks provide automation points within the Git workflow:  
  * prepare-commit-msg: As suggested in the user outline, this hook can automatically inject the story\_id into the commit message. It can be extended to include other metadata like agent\_id, task\_id, or even validate the commit message format against conventional commit standards.  
  * pre-commit: This hook can run linters, style checkers, and quick local unit tests before a commit is finalized. It could also trigger a "pre-commit critic" – a fast LLM check for obvious flaws in the staged changes.  
  * post-commit: After a successful commit, this hook can update the corresponding story's status in index.yml (e.g., to review\_pending or done, if tests pass locally). It can also trigger notifications to other agents (e.g., notify the Reviewer Agent that new code is ready for review) or initiate the next step in an automated workflow.  
* **Ensuring Atomic and Meaningful Commits:** AI agents, particularly Builder and Fixer agents using Aider 3, must be prompted and guided to make small, atomic commits. Each commit should represent a single logical change. Commit messages, ideally generated by the LLM via Aider, should be clear, concise, and follow a conventional format (e.g., Conventional Commits) to ensure a clean and understandable project history. The system should have mechanisms to enforce or encourage this.  
* **Branching Strategy:** A simple, consistent branching strategy is needed. For instance, each user story could have its own feature branch, automatically created by the Planner Agent or the Builder Agent when work begins (e.g., story/\<story\_id\>). All development for that story occurs on this branch. Merges to a main integration branch (e.g., develop or main) would happen only after the code has passed review (automated and/or human) and all CI checks are green.

### **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) for the AI System**

The AI-driven development process should itself be supported by a robust CI/CD pipeline.

* **CI for Agent-Generated Code:** When an AI agent (via Aider) pushes code to a feature branch and a pull request is created, a standard CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) should automatically trigger. This pipeline will run comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, possibly E2E), perform security scans (SAST/DAST), and execute the build process. This aligns with standard CI practices of frequently merging and testing code changes to detect issues early.16  
* **CD of AI-Developed Features:** If all CI checks pass and the code review (automated and/or human) is successful, the system could, for certain types of changes or in specific contexts, automate the merging of the pull request and even the deployment of the feature to staging or production environments. Appropriate human approval gates must be configurable for critical deployments.16  
* **Testing the AI System Itself:** Beyond testing the code produced by AI agents, it's crucial to develop a suite of "meta-tests" to validate the behavior of the entire AI Scrum orchestration system. These tests would verify that the agents, CLI commands, and automated workflows function correctly. For example, a meta-test might involve feeding a sample idea into the system and asserting that a valid PRD is generated, user stories are created appropriately, code is committed for those stories, and index.yml reflects the correct states throughout the process. This is vital for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of the automation.

The entire workflow, from the inception of an idea to the deployment of code, orchestrated by this fleet of AI agents, can be viewed as a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline for generating software. Each agent's output serves as an input for the next, with automated checks (linting, unit testing, critic loops) integrated at various stages. Git hooks and Watchman triggers act as crucial automation points within this meta-pipeline. Applying CI/CD best practices to the design, development, and maintenance of the AI agent workflow itself is therefore critical. This includes versioning prompts and agent configurations, rigorously testing agent logic and decision-making processes, continuously monitoring this "meta-pipeline" for bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and implementing robust rollback mechanisms for AI-driven processes should failures occur.

### **Metrics, Telemetry, and Observability**

Comprehensive data collection and analysis are vital for understanding, managing, and improving the AI system.

* **Comprehensive Metrics:** The system should track a wide array of metrics:  
  * *Throughput Metrics:* Number of user stories completed per day/week, features delivered per cycle, average time from PRD creation to functional code.  
  * *Quality Metrics:* Bug detection rate by the Reviewer Agent versus subsequent human QA, pass/fail rates of the Critic Agent, number of interventions required by the Fixer Agent, automated test coverage achieved by agent-generated tests.  
  * *Cost Metrics:* LLM API token usage (per agent, per task, per story), compute costs associated with running Docker containers for agents.  
  * *Agent Performance Metrics:* Average time taken per task for each agent type, success/failure rates for specific tasks, number of retries required by an agent to complete a task.  
  * *Flow Metrics (inspired by Kanban 4):* Cycle time (time taken for a story to move from ready to done), lead time (total time from idea inception to feature deployment), average Work In Progress (WIP) levels for different agent pools.  
* **Logging:** Detailed logging is essential for debugging and analysis. Every LLM prompt and its corresponding response should be logged (as suggested by prompts.log). Agent decisions, errors encountered, significant state changes in index.yml, and tool interactions should also be recorded using a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate automated parsing and querying. The llm CLI tool's capability to log interactions to an SQLite database can be leveraged for this.7 Effective telemetry is also a key consideration for agentic workflows.14  
* **Visualization:** Metrics and logs should be fed into a visualization platform like Grafana (as suggested in the user outline) or alternatives like Kibana or custom dashboards. These dashboards should provide real-time insights into system health, agent performance, workflow bottlenecks, and overall progress. Visualizing the flow of work items through the various stages defined in .ai/ subdirectories and index.yml can be particularly insightful.  
* **Feedback Loops for Self-Improvement:** The collected telemetry is not just for human oversight; it's a critical enabler for the system's own continuous improvement.  
  * Analysis of metrics can identify poorly performing prompts that consistently lead to low-quality outputs or require many Fixer interventions.  
  * Bottlenecks in the workflow (e.g., a backlog of items waiting for a specific type of agent) can be pinpointed.  
  * This data can be fed into a "Retrospective Agent" or reviewed by human supervisors to drive targeted improvements to the AI system itself—refining prompts, adjusting agent resource allocation, or optimizing workflow logic.

The telemetry system acts as the sensory apparatus for the AI, enabling a degree of self-awareness and providing the foundation for optimization. By meticulously logging prompts, responses, operational metrics, and agent performance data, the system generates a rich dataset describing its own behavior. Analyzing this telemetry allows human overseers—and, in the future, potentially meta-AI agents—to gain deep insights into where the system excels, where it struggles, and where inefficiencies lie. This data-driven approach facilitates targeted interventions, such as refining specific prompts that lead to suboptimal outcomes, reallocating computational resources to overburdened agents, or re-engineering parts of the workflow that prove to be consistent bottlenecks. This transforms the system from a static automation platform into a dynamic, learning system capable of evolving and improving its performance over time. For example, if telemetry reveals that user stories related to a particular domain (e.g., complex financial calculations) consistently require multiple iterations of the Builder-Critic-Fixer loop, this pattern can be flagged. This might lead to suggestions for improving the Planner Agent's story generation prompts for such tasks, or enhancing the Builder Agent's initial coding approach by providing it with more specialized contextual information or examples for that domain.

## **7\. Advanced Considerations and Future Roadmap**

Building such a sophisticated AI-augmented Scrum system requires careful consideration of scalability, cost, security, and extensibility from the outset. A phased roadmap allows for iterative development and learning.

### **Scalability and Performance**

* **Parallelizing Agent Work:** The architecture should support running multiple instances of certain agents concurrently, particularly Builder Agents, to work on different user stories simultaneously. This requires careful management of task assignment and resource allocation.  
* **Optimizing index.yml Access:** As the number of artifacts and agents grows, index.yml could become a performance bottleneck if not managed properly. Strategies might include sharding the index, using more performant data stores for certain types of queries, or implementing optimistic locking or queuing for updates.  
* **Distributed Agents:** For very large-scale operations, the system should be designed to allow agents (as Docker containers) to be distributed across multiple machines or a Kubernetes cluster.

### **Cost Management**

* **Strategic LLM Selection:** Implement logic to choose the most cost-effective LLM for each task. As noted, less complex tasks like summarization or simple classification might use cheaper models (e.g., Claude Haiku or GPT-3.5-turbo), while core generation tasks like coding or PRD writing might require more capable but expensive models (e.g., Claude Sonnet/Opus or GPT-4 series).  
* **Caching LLM Responses:** For identical prompts (especially for non-creative, deterministic tasks), caching LLM responses can significantly reduce API calls and costs.  
* **Budgeting and Alerts:** Integrate mechanisms to track API token usage and overall operational costs. Set budgets and configure alerts to notify administrators if costs exceed predefined thresholds.

### **Security and Guardrails**

* **Sandboxing Agent Execution:** Running agents within Docker containers provides a degree of isolation. Further sandboxing might be necessary, especially if agents can execute arbitrary code or interact with external systems.  
* **Prompt Injection Prevention:** If prompts incorporate external or user-supplied data, careful input validation and sanitization are crucial to prevent prompt injection attacks that could cause agents to behave maliciously or leak sensitive information.  
* **Human Approval Gates:** For critical actions—such as merging code into the main branch, deploying to production, or making significant changes to the Product Backlog—configurable human approval gates must be in place.  
* **Red Teaming Agents:** Proactively test the AI agents for vulnerabilities by "red teaming" them—simulating adversarial attacks to discover ways they might be tricked, manipulated, or caused to fail.13 This includes testing prompt robustness and unexpected interactions between agents.

### **Extensibility**

* **Plugin Architecture for Agents:** Design the system to allow for the easy addition of new agent roles or capabilities, perhaps through a plugin-based architecture where new agent types can be registered with the orchestrator.  
* **Customizable Prompts:** Users should be able to easily customize the prompt templates used by various agents to tailor the system's behavior to their specific project needs or preferences.  
* **LLM Abstraction:** Continue to leverage LLM abstraction layers (like llm-cli 6) to ensure the system can readily support new and improved LLMs as they become available, without requiring major re-engineering.

### **Roadmap**

The development of this AI-augmented Scrum system should itself be an agile endeavor, delivering value incrementally. The "v1.1 spec Atomic Tasks" and the "Unorthodox Backlog Items" from the user's initial outline provide an excellent basis for a phased rollout.

* **v1.0 (Core Functionality \- Foundation):**  
  * Scaffold the oclif CLI (ai).9  
  * Establish the .ai/ directory structure and a basic schema for index.yml.  
  * Create initial prompt stubs for core tasks.  
  * Develop the invokeClaude utility (preferably using llm-cli for flexibility 7 or the direct Anthropic SDK).  
  * Implement the core CLI commands: ai idea, ai prd, ai chunk, ai validate, ai story.  
  * Build the basic YAML index updater logic.  
  * Configure .aider.conf.yml for Aider-Claude integration.3  
  * Create the Docker run wrapper script for the ai aide command, enabling Aider execution.2  
  * Conduct an end-to-end test with a sample idea flowing through to story generation.  
* **v1.1 (Enhanced Automation & Intelligence \- Early "Unorthodox" Features):**  
  * **U-2: Watchman Auto-Chain:** Implement file system watchers (using Watchman 11) to automate the idea \-\> prd \-\> chunk \-\> story pipeline based on file creation/modification.  
  * **U-6: Vector Prompt Boost (Basic):** Implement the ai vector sync command using txtai or sqlite-vectordb. Introduce basic dynamic context injection from the vector store into prompts for Builder Agents.  
  * **U-4: Critic→Fixer Loop (Basic):** Implement the Critic→Fixer loop for one key artifact type, such as user story generation or initial code commits from Builder Agents.  
  * **Git Hooks:** Implement the prepare-commit-msg hook (injecting story\_id) and basic post-commit hooks (e.g., updating index.yml status).  
  * **U-3: Rolling Kanban Bot (Basic):** Develop a simple version of the Scrum-clock bot that can monitor index.yml and move ready stories to in\_progress, assigning them to a conceptual pool of Builder capacity.  
* **v1.5 (LLM-Native Experience & Advanced Agents):**  
  * **U-1: LLM Shell (ai-sh):** Develop the conversational REPL (ai-sh) with natural language understanding for command execution and querying.  
  * **Advanced Embedding Graph:** Enhance the vector store with more sophisticated retrieval techniques like MMR or hybrid search. Improve chunking and metadata strategies.  
  * **Expand Agent Mesh:** Formally implement and differentiate the Reviewer, Fixer, and Planner agents with their specialized prompts, tools, and logic.  
  * **U-5: Grafana Telemetry (Basic):** Set up initial logging of key performance and operational metrics. Create basic Grafana dashboards for visualization.  
* **v2.0 (Self-Optimizing System & Deeper Scrum Integration):**  
  * Full implementation of all Scrum events with dedicated agent support (e.g., a sophisticated Retrospective Agent analyzing telemetry, enhanced Sprint Review facilitation via the CLI).  
  * Introduction of advanced supervisor agent patterns 14 to manage complex, multi-step workflows and orchestrate parallel agent activities.  
  * Implementation of feedback loops where insights from telemetry actively drive the refinement of prompts and agent configurations, moving towards a self-optimizing system.  
  * If performance demands, explore more direct A2A communication mechanisms.15  
  * Comprehensive security hardening, advanced guardrail implementation, and thorough red-teaming of the agent system.

This phased approach, where each version delivers incremental value, allows for continuous learning and adaptation throughout the development lifecycle of this AI system. The "Unorthodox Backlog Items" effectively function as epics, which are progressively broken down and implemented. This iterative strategy is not just a good practice; it mirrors the agile philosophy that the system itself is designed to embody. Early versions will provide invaluable feedback that will inevitably shape the priorities and design choices for later, more advanced iterations.

## **8\. Conclusion: Towards Agile at Lightspeed**

The synthesis of Scrum methodologies with a fleet of AI agents, orchestrated by an LLM-native CLI, holds the promise of fundamentally reshaping software development. This report has outlined a comprehensive technical blueprint for such a system, moving from deep Scrum integration and advanced agentic architecture to intelligent context management and robust operational frameworks. The proposed system aims to transcend simple automation, creating a collaborative environment where human developers are augmented by AI, leading to unprecedented gains in velocity, quality, and innovation.

The journey to realize this vision is complex and requires an iterative, agile approach to development. Key recommendations include:

* **Prioritize Incremental Value:** Focus on delivering core functionalities first (as outlined in v1.0 and v1.1 of the roadmap) and then progressively build out advanced features. Each increment should provide tangible benefits and learning opportunities.  
* **Embrace Continuous Learning:** The development of this AI system is a research and engineering endeavor. Be prepared to adapt prompts, agent logic, and workflow designs based on observed performance and feedback. The telemetry system is crucial for this learning loop.  
* **Focus on Human-AI Collaboration:** While automation is a key goal, the system should be designed to empower human developers, not replace them. Intuitive interfaces, clear observability, and robust human oversight mechanisms are essential.  
* **Invest in Prompt Engineering and Agent Design:** The intelligence and effectiveness of the system are heavily reliant on the quality of prompts and the design of specialized agents. This requires ongoing effort and expertise.

The future of software development is increasingly agentic and agile. By thoughtfully combining the structured discipline of Scrum with the cognitive power of AI, organizations can unlock new levels of productivity and responsiveness. The system detailed herein offers a pathway to that future, enabling teams to approach "Agile at lightspeed," transforming ambitious ideas into impactful software with greater efficiency and creativity than ever before.

================
File: 05_in_progress/0_README.md
================
.ai/in_progress/ – When a story is taken into a sprint for development, its file moves here (or is copied here with status updated to “in_progress”). This represents the active Sprint Backlog. The Builder agent works on these files (e.g., adding implementation notes, linking to code commits). This folder can also hold partial outputs or agent scratchpads during development.

================
File: 06_done/0_README.md
================
.ai/done/ – Completed items are moved here after passing review (i.e., Done in Scrum terms). A story file in done/ indicates that the feature has met its acceptance criteria and is potentially shippable. Optionally, these files could be appended with a summary of what was done, test results, or links to documentation. This provides a historical log of delivered increments per sprint.
